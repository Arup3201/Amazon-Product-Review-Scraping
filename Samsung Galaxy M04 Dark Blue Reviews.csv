12,Tamanna Sarkar,4.0,Nice and worthy,"February 5, 2023",This phone is good and got it in very low price. But this phone doesn't have any fingerprint sensor. Otherwise good.
13,Vishnu VP,4.0,Get it with bundled discounts.,"December 24, 2022","It's original price is not worth any praise so try to purchase on some card offers or other free bundles. The screen is not full HD but still offers good brightness and color accuracy. Speaker also sounds good enough. Front camera is not for selfies only for video calls but back camera produces satisfactory clicks for entry level. Battery backup is one of the best features of this device. Samsung softwares are all well optimised and my only complaint in this department is the pre-installed bloatwares. UI feels smooth enough and the mediatek processor coupled with 4GB RAM is well suited for daily normal usage. Games are not recommended. Biggest disadvantage of this device is it's in box charger which is only 7.75 watts (5v, 1.55a) that takes about 3 hours for a decent charge."
14,Shijas,4.0,Great phone for this price range,"January 16, 2023",For under 10k a great Samsung phone.Great battery life & easy to use.Great UI & loved the in hand feel & yeah it looks beautiful.The charging speed could have been if they included a 15w charger and no fingerprint reader is a miss. As expected in this price range the camera performance is average.

Camera not upto the mark just ok3. Display is good4. Battery backup is also good.5. Buy it only card offers not it's real price.
16,sreejith.c,3.0,Slow.,"February 24, 2023","Phone is  slow, camera is not upto the mark as mentioned, unlocking issue or opening new apps very slowly. Battery 5000 enough for one day full use. Very very very slow charging."

She is not a selfie or video person.Didnt want to go for Realme/Xiaomi(redmi/poco) products because of their support. This already comes with Android 12 and two year updates are assured.The display is really good. Not full HD screen though. Call quality is good.I wanted a smaller size but unfortunately, the price doesnt fall under 10 for them.If you are buying for lots of photos/videos, this is not the phone for you.If you want to use for call & do basic things like whatsapp and other things, this would be a good phone for you."
24,Firaz Ameer K,3.0,Speakers not working. Update - Rectified after visiting authorised service centre.,"December 17, 2022","The phone I received has a malfunctioning speaker.Update -Upgrading from 1 star to 3 star after issues is rectified.The speaker issue was rectified after visiting Samsung service centre.This is my secondary phone. Have been using phone to upgrade Redmi 9A. Using a Samsung phone after 11 years.Pros - Faster processing, no hang issues as of now, Display is decent, Battery life is great, relatively light weight.Cons - Camera quality is not great."
25,Anjali,3.0,Phone is good but operation is not smooth,"February 16, 2023",This phone come with so much already installed apps which makes it function very slow. Although you can remove those apps. I have 64 GB one. Probably could work better.

29,Mohammad Ashraf,3.0,Needs an urgent software update,"December 22, 2022","The phone itself is good at this price bracket, but the front camera is the worst camera I have ever seen in an Android phone. It would be better for Samsung as an established brand to update it's 5 MP front camera which works as 0.3 MP VGA Camera. Rest is ok in this phone as promised and mentioned. The success of this phone could be ruined by only it's Front camera. Now a days everyone uses front camera for Video Calling via WhatsApp, Facebook or direct from Operator, and my personal experience is extremely bad for this particular phone."

56,Digambar,5.0,"Compact for less tech savvy people, bought for mom.","January 22, 2023","This phone is decent enough as per its price point, it can be the best mean device for normal usage and for those who don't have anything much to do with high fi features. A simple device, and easy-to-go device.Just the con is the huge battery size it has, it does not have a fast charging option hence it takes a little longer to fully charge. However, as I said if a user is a very simple user who has nothing to do much with haste can take good time to get charged. Since my mom is a homemaker as per her insights it is a decent choice."

Similar phones from other brand also available but somehow I felt this phone did not give any lag even using for a day.Battery: On full charge it lasted upto 65% for 3 movies on Netflix and  video quality also felt upto HD level.Smooth User interface: being Samsung it‚Äôs obviously smooth and quite faster as expected.Speaker: Not so like surround sound like a basic iPhone SE but felt it‚Äôs quite okay like a basic speaker. But on call, speaker seems to be quite loud and clear.Camera: Can‚Äôt expect much from camera because of only being 13 MP but it‚Äôs okay. In good daylight pics seems to be quite good but not in nightlife.Build Quality:Build quality is okay okay in this segment phone, just like other Samsung low-end phone. But a metal back case would have been good.Biometric: Only FaceID, no fingerprint sensor.RAM: Shows 4 GB, not sure how 8 GB works but it‚Äôs virtual 4 GB that‚Äôs what I learnt. But for phone like this 4 GB also works smooth.Screen size: feels very big, good for watching movies and gaming. Feels super HD quality on playing 4K videos.Storage:64 GB is quite a lot (imagine when iPhone use to come in 16 GB storage, so expensive). Massive storage for camera pics also it‚Äôs expandable."

Camera quality is decent for 13MP, didn't expect like 48/64 MP. Battery backup is outstanding. 6.5 inches LCD display is good enough to play games and browse.
